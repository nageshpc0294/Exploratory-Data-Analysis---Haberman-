# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Haberman Dataset

## About Dataset
The Haberman dataset is a collection of data that relates to the survival of patients who had undergone surgery for breast cancer at the University of Chicago's Billings Hospital between 1958 and 1970. The dataset contains information on the age of the patients at the time of the surgery, the year of the surgery, the number of positive axillary nodes detected, and whether the patients survived for five years or longer after the surgery.

The Haberman dataset is often used in statistical analysis and machine learning applications to study the factors that affect the survival of breast cancer patients. It is widely available in many statistical software packages and can be downloaded from various sources online.

The dataset contains a total of 306 instances or data points, with each instance representing a single patient. The data has been widely analyzed and has been used to develop predictive models to identify patients who are at high risk for breast cancer recurrence or mortality.

## What is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)?
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data that emphasizes exploration and discovery. The goal of EDA is to understand the data, identify patterns and relationships, and generate hypotheses that can be tested further.

EDA typically involves a series of steps that help analysts to understand the data and its properties. These steps include:

Data cleaning: This involves identifying and addressing issues with the data, such as missing values, outliers, or inconsistencies.

Data visualization: This involves creating visual representations of the data, such as plots, histograms, or scatterplots, to identify patterns and relationships.

Data transformation: This involves transforming the data, such as scaling or normalizing it, to make it easier to analyze.

Statistical modeling: This involves using statistical techniques to analyze the data and test hypotheses.

EDA is an important part of the data analysis process because it can help identify issues with the data and guide further analysis. By exploring the data and generating hypotheses, analysts can gain a deeper understanding of the data and its properties, which can inform further analysis and decision-making.
